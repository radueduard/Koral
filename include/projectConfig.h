/**
 * @file projectConfig.h
 * @brief The run parameters of a project: which window to open, and where to look for its files.
 *
 * A project is configured in three layers, each overriding the one before it:
 *
 *   1. **Compiled-in defaults.** A scene library may export
 *      `extern "C" kor::ProjectConfig* CreateProjectConfig()` (separate from CreateScene). This is
 *      the project's own opinion about how it wants to be run, baked into the binary.
 *   2. **The config file** — `koral.json`, next to the project. This is what a user or a tool (the
 *      Hub) edits without recompiling, and it is where the asset and shader directories live.
 *   3. **Command-line flags.** The last word, for overriding one option on one run.
 *
 * The runtime applies them in that order, so a flag beats the file and the file beats the binary.
 *
 * @section koral_json The config file
 *
 * `koral.json` is the Hub's project file. The Hub writes it, the engine reads it, and neither
 * reads anything of the other's — this schema is the entire contract between them.
 *
 * @code{.json}
 * {
 *   "schemaVersion": 1,
 *   "name": "My Game",
 *   "rendering": {
 *     "api": "Vulkan",
 *     "platform": "auto",
 *     "window": {
 *       "width": 1280, "height": 720,
 *       "resizable": true, "fullscreen": false, "borderless": false,
 *       "transparent": false, "vsync": true,
 *       "imguiIni": "imgui.ini"
 *     }
 *   },
 *   "paths": {
 *     "assetDirectories":  ["assets", "../shared/assets"],
 *     "shaderDirectories": ["shaders"]
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Hub's own keys (`color`, `frameworkVersion`, `kind`, `libraries`) mean nothing to the engine
 * and are ignored, as is any key from a newer Hub than this build knows about.
 *
 * Every key is optional: an absent key leaves the layer beneath it alone. `name` is the window
 * title unless `window.title` overrides it. Directories may be relative, and are resolved against
 * the directory holding the config file — so a project can be moved or checked out anywhere without
 * its config needing an edit.
 *
 * @section koral_json_paths Path resolution
 *
 * The directories are the roots that relative paths are resolved against at load time. Given
 * `"assetDirectories": ["assets"]`, a scene that asks for `Importer::LoadImage("textures/wood.png")`
 * gets `<project>/assets/textures/wood.png` — and if it isn't there, Koral keeps looking through the
 * remaining roots, ending with the assets that ship with the engine itself. Config directories are
 * searched first, so a project can shadow an engine asset by name; it can never lose access to the
 * engine's own. Absolute paths are used exactly as given and never resolved.
